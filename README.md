Trakt.tv duplicate / additionnal plays bulk removal  
===========  
This script allows you to remove all the duplicate or additionnal plays for your trakt.tv movies or episodes, and just keep one play per movie / episode (the oldest one).

For instance if you have 3 plays for the movie **Guardians of the Galaxy** at these dates:

 - 2014-08-01T20:00:00.000Z
 - 2017-05-05T22:00:00.000Z
 - 2018-02-05T21:00:00.000Z

The script will keep the oldest play (2014-08-01T20:00:00.000Z) and remove all the others.
If there are no duplicates the script do nothing.
The script backup your data in local json files (movies.json and episodes.json) before doing anything.
